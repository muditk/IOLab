					<p>Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
							Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
							You're the saddest bunch I ever met
							But you can bet before we're through
							Mister, I'll make a man out of you
							Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
							Once you find your center, you are sure to win
							You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
							And you haven't got a clue
							Somehow I'll make a man out of you
							I'm never gonna catch my breath
							Say goodbye to those who knew me
							Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
							This guy's got 'em scared to death
							Hope he doesn't see right through me
							Now I really wish that I knew how to swim
							Be a man
							We must be swift as the coursing river
							Be a man
							With all the force of a great typhoon
							Be a man
							With all the strength of a raging fire
							Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

							Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
							Heed my every order and you might survive
							You're unsuited for the rage of war
							So pack up, go home, you're through
							How could I make a man out of you?

							Be a man
							We must be swift as the coursing river
							Be a man
							With all the force of a great typhoon
							Be a man
							With all the strength of a raging fire
							Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

							Be a man
							We must be swift as the coursing river
							Be a man
							With all the force of a great typhoon
							Be a man
							With all the strength of a raging fire
							Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

					<p>Aladdin: I can show you the world
							Shining, shimmering, splendid
							Tell me, princess, now when did
							You last let your heart decide?

							Aladdin: I can open your eyes
							Take you wonder by wonder
							Over, sideways and under
							On a magic carpet ride

							Aladdin: A whole new world
							A new fantastic point of view
							No one to tell us no or where to go
							Or say we're only dreaming



							Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
							A dazzling place I never knew
							But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
							That now I'm in a whole new world with you
							Aladdin: (Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
							Princess Jasmine: Unbelievable sights
							Indescribable feelings
							Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
							Through an endless diamond sky

							Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
							Aladdin: (Don't you dare close your eyes)
							Princess Jasmine: A hundred thousand things to see
							Aladdin: (Hold your breath, it gets better)

							Princess Jasmine: I'm like a shooting star
							I've come so far
							I can't go back
							To where I used to be

							Aladdin: A whole new world
							Princess Jasmine: Every turn a surprise

							Aladdin: With new horizons to pursue
							Princess Jasmine: Every moment red letter
							Both: I'll chase them anywhere
							There's time to spare
							Let me share this whole new world with you

							Aladdin: A whole new world
							Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
							Aladdin: That's where we'll be
							Princess Jasmine: That's where we'll be
							Aladdin: A thrilling chase
							Princess Jasmine: A wondrous place
							Both: For you and me
